Integration of XAgent into L3AGI Framework
Objective:
Replace the existing Langchain REACT Agent in the L3AGI framework with the XAgent framework.

Background Information:
- L3AGI Framework: https://github.com/l3vels/team-of-ai-agents 
- XAgent Framework: https://github.com/OpenBMB/XAgent 


Tasks:
1. Understand the Existing Implementation:
   - Review the L3AGI framework, focusing on areas where Langchain REACT Agent(https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react) is currently implemented.
   - Key files to examine: `test.py`, `conversational.py`, `dialogue_agent_with_tools.py`.

2. Plan the Replacement:
   - Document the functionalities of the Langchain REACT Agent within L3AGI.
   - Outline how these functionalities will be replicated or replaced by XAgent.


3. Implement the Replacement:
   - Remove the Langchain REACT Agent from the L3AGI framework.
   - Integrate the XAgent framework, ensuring it fulfills the roles previously handled by the Langchain REACT Agent.
   - Ensure that the integration is seamless and maintains the integrity of the L3AGI framework.

4. Testing and Documentation:
   - Thoroughly test the framework to ensure that all functionalities work as expected with XAgent.
   - Document the changes made, including any new functionalities or alterations to existing features.
 

Deliverables:
- A modified version of the L3AGI framework with XAgent successfully integrated in your GitHub repo and share the link for submission with a screenshot that it is working.
- A detailed report documenting:
  - The process followed for removing the Langchain REACT Agent and integrating XAgent.
  - Any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
  - Testing procedures and results.
  - Any additional notes or observations.


Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness and completeness of the integration.
- Quality and clarity of the documentation.
- Effectiveness of the testing process.
- Innovation in approach and problem-solving.


Deadline:
- 24 hours from the time of assignment.
